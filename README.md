Hey there, and welcome to the code workshop! I'm so glad you're here.

This repository is the central hub for every single line of code, every project, and every challenge from our entire A-Z course. We don't do boring lectures; we get our hands dirty and build cool stuff that will take you from an absolute beginner to a job-ready AI developer.

How to Use This Repository
This repo is your personal library of code. It's organized to follow our video courses exactly, allowing you to learn, experiment, and build your professional portfolio.

Find Your Course: Everything is sorted into two main folders:

course-1-python-foundation

course-2-ai-developer-path

Navigate to the Video: Inside each course folder, you'll find modules and then individual folders numbered to match the videos (e.g., 01-HelloWorld).

Code & Challenge: Inside each video folder, you'll find the completed code and a README.md file with a summary and your specific challenge for that lesson.

The Courses
Our curriculum is designed as one continuous journey following our 8-step roadmap. Start with Course 1 and work your way up!

üêç Course 1: The Python Foundation

ü§ñ Course 2: The Professional AI Developer Path

This is where your journey begins. We'll take you from zero to a proficient Python programmer, ready to tackle the world of data science and AI while building fun projects like a text-based adventure game.

With your Python skills sharpened, this is where we build real AI. We'll dive into machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and NLP. By the end, you'll have a portfolio of impressive AI applications.
